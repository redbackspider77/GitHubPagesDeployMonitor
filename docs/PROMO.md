# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deploy Monitor

If you’ve ever developed a website with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you’ve probably felt the pain:

You push a change… then refresh your site... again and again… waiting until it is eventually updated server-side.

So I made a tool to solve that uncertainty:

## 🎯 What It Does

**[GitHub Pages Deploy Monitor](https://github.com/redbackspider77/GitHubPagesDeployMonitor)** is a lightweight Windows app that:
- Watches your GitHub Pages repository for new commits
- Monitors the deployment status checks (via the GitHub API)
- Notifies you when the deploy is actually **done**, so you can stop guessing
- Lets you customize how and when it checks

## 🛠 Features

- 🔄 **Tracks deploys in real-time** (via check runs)
- 🔔 **Sends Windows toast notifications** when deploy finishes
- ⚙️ **Customizable** polling interval, branches, repo settings, etc.
- 🧼 **Simple UI** with minimal distractions
- 🪛 Easy `.msi` installer for Windows 10+
